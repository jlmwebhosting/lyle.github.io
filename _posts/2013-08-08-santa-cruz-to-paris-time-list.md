title: Santa Cruz to Paris Times List

{{ page.title }}
================

I live in Santa Cruz, CA, USA. Because we do that whole "daylight savings" thing in the "non winter" we are effectivly two time zones.

* Pacific Standard Time [PST] which is -8 hours UTC 
* Pacific Daylight Time [PSD] which is -7 hours UTC - starts mid March (10th 2013) and goes til early November (3rd 2013).

I work with a bunch of [wonderful people in Paris](https://plus.google.com/photos/101982392616981120013/albums/5909901167352714081), France. Paris also does that whole "daylight savings" thing.

* Central European Time [CET] which is +1 hours UTC
* Central European Summer Time [CEST] which is +2 hours UTC - starts late March (31st 2013) and goes til late October (27 2013)

In France they use a 24 hour clock and in the states we use AM and PM.
